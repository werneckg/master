These experiments are part of the master's research in Computer Science from Department of Computer Science Institute of Mathematics and Statistics of University of SÃ£o Paulo. They present the results obtained from the application of classification-related machine learning algorithms to perform the placement of security VNFs that implement DDoS attack mitigation approaches.

This repository is divided into:
- dataset: the set of training and testing data used; and
- code: containing the Jupyter Notebook with the experiments in Python.
